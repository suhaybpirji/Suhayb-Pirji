### Hi there, I am Suhayb Pirji

I am an ICT graduate from De Montfort University, with a profound interest in cloud technologies. I am currently participating in an AWS Cloud Computing Academy program, where I am gaining proficiency in AWS services and technologies such as S3, EC2, VPC, and Lambda. I have also obtained two AWS certifications: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate.

My goal is to pivot my career towards the realm of DevOps, where I can apply my cloud computing skills and knowledge to architect scalable, secure, and resilient cloud infrastructures. I am eager to learn from and contribute to DevOps environments, fostering operational efficiency and achieving collaborative success. I am also keen to mentor and guide others in deploying AWS services, emphasizing best practices and industry standards.
